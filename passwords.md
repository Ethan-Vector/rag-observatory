# Password Reset Policy

If a user forgets their password, they can reset it using the "Forgot Password" link on the login page.
A reset email will be sent to the user's registered email address.

Security notes:
- Reset links expire after 30 minutes.
- A reset link can only be used once.
- If the user does not receive the email, verify spam folder and email address on file.
